Examine the code given in "PartialSum.png" and "Demo.png" carefully. Now using that code as reference, write a your own multithreaded program to find the largest number from a very large array of random long integer numbers.

1. each thread should find largest number from a specific portion of the array and return that number to main thread. Finaly main thread will find largst of the numbers returned by the child threads.

2. Your code MUST be indented properly. Unindented code will be rejected.

3. Use meaningful name for your classes and methods according to java naming convnsion (google it, if you dont know what the convensions are)
